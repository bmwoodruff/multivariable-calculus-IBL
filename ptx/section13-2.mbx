  <title>Changing Coordinate Systems: The Jacobian</title>
  <p>
    After finishing this section, you should...
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be able to change between standard coordinate systems for triple integrals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Spherical Coordinates
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Cylindrical Coordinates
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Just as we did with polar coordinates in two dimensions, we can compute a Jacobian for any change of coordinates in three dimensions. We will focus on cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember that the Jacobian of a transformation is found by first taking the derivative of the transformation, then finding the determinant, and finally computing the absolute value.

      The cylindrical change of coordinates is:
      <md>
        <mrow>x\amp =r\cos\theta, y=r\sin\theta, z=z</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{ or in vector form } \amp \</mrow>
        <mrow>\vec C(r,\theta,z) \amp = (r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta, z)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      The spherical change of coordinates is:
      <md>
        <mrow>x\amp =\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta,\ y=\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta,\ z=\rho\cos\phi</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{ or in vector form } \amp \</mrow>
        <mrow>\vec S(\rho,\phi,\theta) \amp = (\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta,\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta,\rho\cos\phi).</mrow>
      </md>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Verify that the Jacobian of the cylindrical transformation is <m>\ds\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(r,\theta,z)} = |r|</m>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If you want to make sure you don't have to use absolute values, what must you require?
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Verify that the Jacobian of the spherical transformation is <m>\ds\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(\rho,\phi,\theta)} = |\rho^2\sin\phi|</m>.
            <ul>
              <li>

                  If you want to make sure you don't have to use absolute values, what must you require?

    The previous exercise shows us that, provided we require <m>r\geq0</m> and <m>0\leq \phi\leq \pi</m>, we can write:
    <me>
      dV=dxdydz = rdrd\theta dz = \rho^2\sin\phi d\rho d\phi d\theta,
    </me>

      <p>
        You'll need to find where the surface intersect, as their intersection will help you determine the appropriate bounds.

    For the next several exercises be sure to check that you've correctly swapped bounds by having Sage or WolframAlpha actually compute all of the integrals.
