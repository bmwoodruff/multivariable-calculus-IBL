    In first semester calculus, we learned that the area under a function <m>f(x)</m> above the <m>x</m>-axis is given by <m>A = \int_a^b f(x) dx</m>. The quantity <m>dA= f(x) dx</m> represents a small bit of area whose length is <m>dx</m> and whose height is <m>f(x)</m>. To get the total area, we just added up the little bits of area, which is why
    <me>
      A=\int dA = \int_a^b f(x) dx.

    Our results from the exercise above suggest the following definition.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <title>Line Integral</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <!-- \extrafn{The line integral is also called the path integral, contour integral, or curve integral.} -->Let <m>f</m> be a function and let <m>C</m> be a piecewise smooth curve whose parametrization is <m>\vec r(t)</m> for <m>t\in[a,b]</m>. We'll require that the composition <m>f(\vec r(t))</m> be continuous for all <m>t\in [a,b]</m>. Then we define the line integral
        of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> to be the integral
        <me>
          \int_C f ds 
          = \int_a^b f(\vec r(t))\frac{ds}{dt}dt
          = \int_a^b f(\vec r(t))\left|\frac{d\vec r}{dt}\right|dt.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Notice that this definition suggests the following four steps. These four steps are the key to computing any line integral. <!-- \extrafn{When we ask you to set up a line integral, it means that you should do steps 1<ndash />3, so that you get an integral with a single variable and with bounds that you could plug into a computer or complete by hand.} -->

      <li>
        <p>
          Find the speed by computing the velocity <m>\dfrac{d\vec r}{dt}</m> and then the speed <m>\left|\dfrac{d\vec r}{dt}\right|</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>

  <p>
    Work, flow, circulation, and flux are all examples of line integrals. Remember that work, flow, and circulation are
    <me>
      W=\int_C (\vec F\cdot \vec T)ds =\int_C (M,N)\cdot(dx,dy) =  \int_C Mdx+Ndy,
    </me>
    while the formula for flux is
    <me>
      \Phi=\int_C (\vec F\cdot \vec n)ds =\int_C (M,N)\cdot(dy,-dx) =  \int_C Mdy+Ndx.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you see how these are both the line integral of a function <m>f = \vec F\cdot \vec T</m> or <m>f=\vec F\cdot \vec n</m> along a curve <m>C</m>. The function <m>f</m> inside the integrand does not have to represent the height of a sheet. We'll use it to represent lots of things. Let's practice two more work/flux exercises, to sharpen our skills with these concepts.

          <p>
            Look at a drawing of <m>C</m> and the vector field (see margin for the Sage link).  We'll move along the triangle in a counter clockwise manner. Without doing any computations, for each side of the triangle make a guess to determine if the flow along that edge is positive, negative, or zero. Similarly, guess the sign of the flux along each edge.  Explain.
