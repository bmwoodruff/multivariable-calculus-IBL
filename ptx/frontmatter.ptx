		<title>Mathematical Truths</title>
		  <p>
		    From Dr. Woodruff:
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    This course may be like no other course in mathematics you have ever taken. We'll discuss in class some of the key differences, and eventually this section will contain a complete description of how this course works. For now, it's just a skeleton.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    I received the following email about 6 months after a student took the course:
		  </p>

		  <blockquote>
		  Hey Brother Woodruff,

		  I was reading <em>Knowledge of Spiritual Things</em> by Elder Scott.
		  I thought the following quote would be awesome to share with your
		  students, especially those in Math 215 :)
			  <blockquote>
			  Profound [spiritual] truth cannot simply be poured
			  from one mind and heart to another. It takes faith
			  and diligent effort. Precious truth comes a small
			  piece at a time through faith, with great exertion,
			  and at times wrenching struggles.
			  </blockquote>

		  </blockquote>

		  <p>
		    Elder Scott's words perfectly describe how we acquire mathematical truth, as well as spiritual truth.

	  <title>Teaching philosophy</title>
		  <p>
		    From Dr. Schmitt:
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    Over time, I've come to view teaching and learning as a shared journey on which my students and I
		    embark each semester. I am the subject matter expert responsible for
		    providing information and guidance, setting expectations, and
		    assessing how well students meet those expectations. My students are
		    responsible for much hard work, including preparing in advance for
		    class, participating in class activities, and doing out-of-class
		    assignments, regardless of whether or not they are graded. There is
		    only so much that can be conveyed in <m>50</m> minutes, and my own personal
		    experience and educational research agree that students get far less
		    out of a <m>50</m>-minute lecture than their professors hope. Thus, I have
		    chosen to take an approach that is more work both for you and for me
		    but has been shown to produce better results. During class you
		    will work on a carefully chosen series of problems designed to build
		    the mathematical knowledge and experience you need to succeed. These
		    problems will be done in a collaborative, small group setting where
		    you can grapple with and truly understand the material. I'll be there to support, guide, and correct
		    misconceptions. Sure, I could expect you to do this alone outside of
		    class, but over time I've realized a few things about working in
		    groups. As a student, I usually understood something better when I
		    went over it with classmates, even if I was the one who thought I
		    understood it completely and explained it to a peer. As a researcher,
		    I am more productive and effective when I collaborate. Friends in
		    industry report that teams are increasingly used to produce the best
		    results. Furthermore, having me there to help in the early stages
		    ensures that we're traveling together on this journey.
